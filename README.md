## Teadot Menu/Drink Tracker

### Overview

In my personal project, I will be designing an interactive menu for the bubble tea store Teadot. The application
will let users **view the various drinks**, and **log drink orders**. The application will then track these drink
orders, and compile useful information, including: **the quantity of ingredients used over certain time periods**,
**which times of day are busiest for different days**, and **the popularity of different drinks**.

Employees would use the application to log drinks as they are ordered. Then the manager will be able to view this
data at any time, and can then use it to inform decisions related to the operation of the store, such as how much
to prep every day, when to schedule workers, what drinks to put on special, and so forth.

As an employee of Teadot, this project holds interest to me as I would be a primary user. We often find ourselves
in the situation of not having enough prepped, or having too much prepped that we then need to throw out as it
goes bad. We also sometimes find ourselves without enough workers, especially during different times of the year.
Being able to gather and view data would help us be more efficient and improve the quality of our work.
